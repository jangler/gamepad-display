# gamepad-display

this program graphically displays the inputs of a gamepad using
[love2d](https://love2d.org/). the first (and last) detected gamepad to press a
button will be displayed. the layout is that of an SNES controller sans
shoulder buttons.

the button and axis mapping is not currently configurable except by modifying
the source code.
